			<p>Welcome...</p>
			<p>Hi, I'm Dani Iverson-Rewald and I am currently a student pursuing my dreams at being a successful web designer. Although I am still learning, I am seasoned well. Hard work and dedication is what I thrive on.</p>
			<p>I am a great multitasker capable of bringing simultaneous web page creations and repair projects to completion with full accuracy and efficiency. Being able to function well independently with little to no supervision or in coordination with a professional electronic media team is my specialty.</p>
       		<p> I am a designer with a passion for clean and functional websites and user interfaces.</p>
			<p>I am also a coder with experience in HTML, CSS, Wordpress, jQuery and PHP. My main focus is writing clean, organized and efficient code.</p>
			<p>"Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you haven't planted"
          	 -David Bly
